# Welcome to Lil Engie 2 Docs

An open source game engine 

Lil Engie 2 is currently in development and not ready to be used to build any games, you can however use this as a learning resource!

To follow the delopment and keep up with the changes to the engines as well as implementation details/notes, please refer to the trello board that I use for development. 
[Lil Engie Trello](https://trello.com/b/W6GGGBLa/lilengie2)

The documentation is also in development and everything will be manually written. While this means the documentation that is provided will actually be much more helpful, this also means that until these docs are caught up with the devlopment of Lil Engie, it will not cover everything in the engine.
